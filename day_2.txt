Day 2

The second important topic in learning any programming language is understanding the different data types that we can use in that language. programmer almost always they start counting from zero.

The most common data type language is 
1- string : this type store collection of charactors and the string text is puted between double quotes"". Example : "ahmed".
we can use [] symobles to get subscript of the string like if we would like to get the A letter from the word "ahmed" , we use "ahmed"[0]
2-Integer : whole number without digits like 123. we can use the underscore to make large numbers more readable like 123_345_632 and the computer will use it as 123345632.
3-Float   : floating nmumber like 3.5
4-Boolen  :  true or false

we can only concante string when we use it in print. For example, if we try to print("hu"+5) we will get an error as we can only conantate strings.
we can use the type function to know the data type of a variable. we can change the data type of a variable by casting it like str(Int) will convert it to string.
we can use below function to convert :
str()
Int()
float()

we can use the ** mathmatical operator to get the power of number like 2 ** 2 = 4.

The order or precedance in python :
()
**
* /
+ - 

we can use // to get the divided result as a whole number instead of float without the need to use the round or int function.

you can divide or do any operation to the variable by puting the operation before the equal like this :
result /= 2 to divide the result variable with 2.

we can use f-string to put other type of variable inside the string by putting the f before the "" and put the variable inside {}.
f"this is the total {total}"
