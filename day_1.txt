The other function that we will talk about is the input function where user can input a value that we use in our program.
Like if we would like to print the user name , we use ask the user to put their name once promted, we print it:
input("what is your name")
once the user enter the data , that data will be placed instead of the input function. so we can print the user name as follows :
print(input("what is your name"))

There is a tool called thony which can show how code is executed step by step.

we can use # in order to write it as comment.

There is a function called len which can be used to calcuate the number of character.
len("String")

we can define variable to store values where we can use it later on. like storing the value from user input like this
name = input("what is your name")
we can then print that variable
print("name is " + name)
